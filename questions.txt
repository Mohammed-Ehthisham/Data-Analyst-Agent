Please analyze the attached sales CSV and return exactly these fields:
- total_sales
- top_region
- day_sales_correlation
- bar_chart (as data:image/png;base64,...)
- median_sales
- total_sales_tax (assume 10%)
- cumulative_sales_chart (as data:image/png;base64,...)

The dataset has columns: date, region, sales. Compute values accurately. Ensure the plot images are base64 data URIs and kept reasonably small. This is a CSV analysis task.
